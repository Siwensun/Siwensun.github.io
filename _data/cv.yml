    - title: Research Intern
      institution: NEC Labs America
      year: 2023.06 - 2023.09
      description:
        - Participated in long-horizon closed-loop neural sensor simulator project. 
        - With a single recorded log captured by a sensor-equipped vehicle, our simulator can synthesize a realistic closed-loop RGB video. 
        - Built upon neural radiance field, Lidar and high-definition map are demonstrated to be useful in extrapolated traffic scene synthesis scenario.
        - Parts of our project leads to CVPR 2024 hightlights paper (LidaRF) and oral presentation at DDADS workshop.
    - title: Machine Learning Engineer
      institution: Deepvoxel, Inc.
      year: 2019.08 - 2021.05
      description:
        - Developed deep learning-based organs-at-risk delineation algorithm for more than 50 anatomical structures from whole-body CT scans. 
        - Integrate our algorithms into their first FDA-cleared product, which was applied by several medical institutions in radiology treatment planning.
        - Parts of our algorithm lead to domain top-tier journal Radiotherapy and Oncology paper (WBNet).
