I am a research scientist at Meta, working on video generation. My primary research interests are at the intersection of **computer vision, computer graphics and generative AI**.

Before that, I graduated as Ph.D. from the [Department of Computer Science at University of California, Irvine](https://cs.ics.uci.edu/) (UCI), advised by Prof. [Xiaohui Xie](https://ics.uci.edu/~xhx/), focuing on 3D recontrsuction and generation. During my PhD, I was fortunate to intern at NEC Labs America with [Bingbing Zhuang](https://bbzh.github.io/) and [Ziyu Jiang](https://geekjzy.github.io/), building neural world simulation. 

Earlier, I obtained my Master's degree from [University of Southern California](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) (USC) and Bachelor's degree from [Beihang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beihang_University) (BUAA).

<!-- **Currently**, I am working on:

- **Text-Driven Human Motion Generation** with multi-modal agents,
- **Image Decomposition and Composition** by repurposing generative model.  -->
