I am a final-year **Ph.D. candidate** in the [Department of Computer Science at University of California, Irvine](https://cs.ics.uci.edu/) (UCI), advised by Prof. [Xiaohui Xie](https://ics.uci.edu/~xhx/). 

Earlier, I obtained my Master's degree from [University of Southern California](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) (USC) and my Bachelor's degree from [Beihang University](https://yqgdxy.buaa.edu.cn/) (BUAA).

My primary research interests are at the intersection of **computer vision, computer graphics and generative AI**. Also, I have been actively engaged in medical image analysis.

**Currently**, I am working on:

- **Text-Driven Human Motion Generation** with multi-modal agents,
- **Image Decomposition and Composition** by repurposing generative model. 

<p style="color: red;">
I am on the job market, looking for research scientist / engineer positions: part-time internships before summer 2025 and full-time positions starting from summer 2025. 
</p> Happy to be connected at **shanlins[at]uci[dot]edu.**
