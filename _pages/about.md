I am a 4th-year **Ph.D. student** in the [Department of Computer Science at University of California, Irvine](https://cs.ics.uci.edu/) (UCI), advised by Prof. [Xiaohui Xie](https://ics.uci.edu/~xhx/). I obtained my Master's degree from [University of Southern California](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) (USC) in 2019 and my Bachelor's degree from [Beihang University](https://yqgdxy.buaa.edu.cn/) (BUAA) in 2017.

My primary research interests are at the intersection of **computer vision, computer graphics and generative AI**. Additionally, I have been actively engaged in medical image analysis.

**Currently**, I am focusing on three research topics:

- Synthesizing diverse 4D data paired with **detailed text descriptions**,
- Generating **relightable** 3D object/scene from single/few observations, and
- **Repurposing** image generation models for image decomposition. 

I am open to research collaborations and job opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me via email at shanlins<span style="color:orange">[at]</span>uci<span style="color:orange">[dot]</span>edu.
